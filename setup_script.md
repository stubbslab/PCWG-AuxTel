These are the package versions currently required for interfacing with the data.
I (Merlin) endeavor to keep this up-to-date as ticket versions change and branches merge, but there will surely be times when I forget.
So, if things aren't working:

1) Check that you've got all these packages checked out, _and_ setup so that they're being used by your kernel (_i.e._ in your notebooks.user_setups file)
2) Check that you're on the right branches of all the packages listed below
3) Check that you've done a git pull
    - if you do a git pull and it doesn't Just Workâ„¢ *AND* you haven't made any code changes in that package, then you can almost certainly fix the problem by doing:
    git reset --hard origin && git checkout tickets/\<DM-whatever\> && git pull
    but do note that if you've made code changes to the repo that these will be lost.

The following list of packages and ticket branches is given in a such a form that you can copy and paste them in.
Do note that because this is a work-in-progress and you're building off of ticket branches that the scons line won't always return without errors, and that sometimes I put it before the git checkout, and sometimes after, depending on whether I think it will succeed or not.

Currently recommended stack version: w_2021_21
Currently recommended rerun location for processed data: /project/shared/auxTel/rerun/mfl/binning4/
